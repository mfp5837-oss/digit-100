        <p>I thought this game had very good graphics and identifiers for the charcters. The opening segment of the game all characters are introducted to player. </p><p> Elaine and Leo serve as side characters while Boyd is secondeory character and Sarah is our main. 
        Each character is easy to tell apart by the color of their clothes. Elaine has pink, Leo has purple, Boyd is blue, and Sarah is red and she also had glasses. Throughtout the whole game you can only play as Sarah. </p>
        
      </br>  <p>The Unknown character apperas in the last segment of the game and the entity appears throughout the entire game. </p>
        
    </br><p>  The man character is seen in the secound half he tells the group to not go any futher into the mountains. </p>
        
    </br>
           <h2>The Music Score</h2>
        <p>I thought the music was very fitting for the game and it provided elements of suspence as well as horror. </p> </br>
        
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>I thought that the gameplay was super easy to get adjusted to interacting with different elements in the game never felt like a boring task and didn't take up a lot of time. 
     </br>   The begining of the game has the player (Sarah) in a car with her friends. You can interact with different objects for example there are some notes that you can find that were left by other hikers that got stuck. Towards the end of the game you can pick up a hammer and planks to finish a bridge.
        </p>

          <p>
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>Here are some images that I pulled from the game. 
            <br>I thought these were intresting to look at.
       <br> The colors and shapes really set a creepy atmosphere to match
            the erieness of the enviorment of the game. <br>
        The deep blues and reds mixed some purple make the structers you come across stand out as well.</p>

        <h2>Game Lore?</h2>
        <p>While progressing in the game there is an monster that chases you and your group through all levels of the game. The last level has images of the monster and what looks to be others just like it in some of the images.
        The monster is depicted in every image and it's shown to be burning under an unknow being and others are being lifted into the air.  </p>
