        <p>I thought this game had very good graphics and identifiers for the charcters. The opening segment of the game all characters are introducted to player. Elaine and Leo serve as side characters while Boyd is secondeory character and Sarah is our main. 
        Each character is easy to tell apart by the color of their clothes. Elaine has pink, Leo has purple, Boyd is blue, and Sarah is red and she also had glasses. Throughtout the whole game you can only play as Sarah. </p>
        
      </br>  <p>The Unknown character apperas in the last segment of the game and the entity appears throughout the entire game. </p>
        
    </br><p>  The man character is seen in the secound half he tells the group to not go any futher into the mountains. </p>
        
    </br>
           <h2>The Music Score</h2>
        <p>I thought the music was very fitting for the game and it provided elements of suspence as well as horror. </p>
        
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>I thought that the gameplay was super easy to get adjusted to interacting with different elements in the game never felt like a boring task and didn't take up a lot of time. </p>
