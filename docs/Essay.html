        <p>I love coding with oxygen and pushing onto my repo in github! It takes a littlte longer this way but fir the cding portation makes it 
            worth it becase elements and attributes are color coded so it's easier to find things in your code.</p> 
        
            <p>Although this way of coding a website takes a little longer with the extra steps to pushing your code
            I like that using github and oxygen it gives the user moreways to experment with their code and put extreme detail into their website.
        I personally love github and oxygen more then wordpress because oof its looks how its runs and it's user interface.</p>
        
        <p>After using Oxygen and Github for about a month I feel pretty confident in making the basic elements to a webpage and using Github and Gitbash to create it!</p>
